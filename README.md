# Lem-in
You must move your ant colony from one point to another.
# Lem_in

This project is a game about ant farm. Its goal is to find the shortest path from start room to the end.

### Studied:

1. Graph theory (breadth-first search, depth-first search, maximum flow problem, Dijkstra's algorithm)
2. Complex data structures(stack, turn)
3. Hashing, binary search, dynamic array (analog of a vector in C++)
3. SDL2/SDL_TTF

### Use:
 - `make`

 - `./lem-in < <maps> [ | ./viz]`

### Example:

`./lem-in < maps/maps3.map | ./viz`

### Visualization
Lem_in virtual machine visualization written using the SDL2 library.
 - To speed up ants, use the plus on numpad.
 - To slow down use minus
 - Use the arrows to move the graph.
 - To exit, press Esc
